# Alpha Testing Protocol

**Last Updated:** July 10, 2025  
**Testing Phase:** Alpha (Internal + Close Athletes)  
**Target:** 5-10 committed test users for 1-2 weeks

## 🎯 Testing Objectives

2. **Adoption:** Do users complete 5+ workouts in first week?
3. **Preference:** Do users prefer this to their current method?
4. **Retention:** Do users continue past initial enthusiasm?

## 👥 Alpha User Recruitment

Subject: Test a 30-Second Workout Tracker (1-2 weeks)

Hi [Name],

I've built a workout tracker that takes under 30 seconds to log any workout. 
The goal is to prove whether ultra-simple beats feature-rich for building 
exercise habits.

Would you be willing to test it for 1-2 weeks? I need athletes who:
- Work out 5+ times per week
- Currently track workouts somehow
- Can spare 30 seconds post-workout to log it

In return: You get early access to a tool that might actually stick, 
plus your feedback shapes the final product.

Interested? Reply and I'll send you the link + brief instructions.

Thanks!

## 📊 Data Collection Strategy

### Quantitative Metrics

#### 1. Logging Speed Measurement
**Method:** Direct observation during user testing sessions
- **Setup:** Screen recording + stopwatch during first few logs
- **Target:** <30 seconds from app open to completion celebration
- **Frequency:** First 3 workouts, then spot checks

#### 2. Usage Frequency Tracking  
**Method:** Built-in analytics (localStorage reading)
- **Metrics:** Daily active users, workouts logged per week
- **Target:** 5+ workouts in first week, 4+ ongoing
- **Frequency:** Daily monitoring, weekly summaries

#### 3. Retention Measurement
**Method:** Weekly check-ins via simple survey
- **Week 1:** Still using? How many workouts logged?
- **Week 2:** Still using? Preference vs old method?
- **Target:** >60% still using at week 2

### Qualitative Feedback

#### Post-Workout Observation (Week 1)
**Method:** Watch 2-3 users log workouts in person/video
- **Questions:** What feels slow? What's confusing? Any friction points?
- **Focus:** Actual behavior vs stated preferences

#### Mid-Week Check-in (Day 4-5)
**Method:** Brief phone call or message
- **Questions:** 
  - "How long is logging taking you?"
  - "What would make you stop using this?"
  - "How does this compare to your old method?"

#### End-of-Week Survey (Day 7 & 14)
**Method:** Simple Google Form (5 questions max)
1. **Usage:** How many workouts did you log this week?
2. **Speed:** Average time to log a workout?
3. **Preference:** This app vs your previous method? (Scale 1-5)
4. **Continuation:** Will you keep using this? Why/why not?
5. **Improvement:** One thing that would make this better?

## 🔧 Testing Setup

### Pre-Test Preparation
1. **Deploy to Production:** Vercel deployment with custom domain
2. **Analytics Setup:** Basic usage tracking via localStorage analysis
3. **Feedback Collection:** Google Form and direct message channels
4. **User Instructions:** Simple onboarding guide (1 page max)

### User Onboarding Flow
```
Day 0: Send app link + 1-page instructions
Day 1: Check in - did they log their first workout?
Day 3: Quick message - how's it going?
Day 7: Week 1 survey + continued usage check
Day 14: Week 2 survey + final feedback collection
```

### Instructions Template
```
Welcome to Athletic Tracker Alpha Testing!

GOAL: Test if 30-second workout logging actually works

YOUR TASK:
1. Log every workout for the next 1-2 weeks
2. Time yourself on a few logs (let me know the times)
3. Give honest feedback about what works/doesn't

THE APP:
- Link: [Your deployment URL]
- Just 3 taps: workout type + duration + rating
- That's it - no accounts, no complexity

FEEDBACK:
Text me directly or email with any thoughts
I'll check in at Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14

Thanks for helping validate this!

## 📈 Success Criteria

### Week 1 Success Signals
- **✅ 80%+ complete 5+ workout logs**
- **✅ Average logging time <30 seconds**  
- **✅ Zero users abandon due to complexity**
- **✅ Users report preference over current method**

### Week 2 Retention Signals
- **✅ 60%+ still actively logging workouts**
- **✅ Users choose app over old method when given choice**
- **✅ Word-of-mouth recommendations to other athletes**
- **✅ Feature requests focus on polish, not major additions**

### Failure Indicators (Pivot Signals)
- **❌ Average logging time >45 seconds consistently**
- **❌ >30% abandon before completing 5 workouts**
- **❌ Users return to previous tracking methods**
