**Status:** 🏗️ DATABASE SCHEMA UPDATED - Event Banking Foundation Complete  
**Location:** `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp`  
**Production URL:** https://athletic-tracker-kuh17lzh-alain-sergiles-projects.vercel.app

## 🎯 Current State

### 🏗️ **EVENT BANKING DATABASE FOUNDATION COMPLETE (This Session):**
- **✅ Database Migration Applied:** Successfully ran `001_add_events_and_goals.sql` migration
- **🗄️ New Tables Created:** `events` and `athlete_goals` tables ready for banking system
- **⚙️ User Settings Updated:** Added `weekly_workout_frequency` column (defaults to 4 workouts/week)
- **🔒 Security Configured:** Row Level Security policies for events and goals
- **🛠️ Database Helpers Updated:** Added comprehensive event/goal management functions to `src/lib/supabase.js`
- **📊 Banking Logic Built:** Automatic target calculation based on weeks remaining × weekly frequency
- **📝 Migration Files:** Organized migration system in `database/migrations/` with rollback instructions

### 🎯 **EVENT-DRIVEN BANKING SYSTEM READY:**
- **Core Concept Validated:** Athletes create events ("State Championships - March 15") with personal goals
- **Forward-Looking Banking:** Only workouts after goal creation count toward targets
- **Multi-Event Support:** One workout contributes to all active goals simultaneously
- **Automatic Targeting:** System calculates targets based on event date and athlete's weekly frequency
- **Progress Tracking:** Shows "15 of 32 workouts banked" with days remaining countdown

### 💾 **DATABASE SCHEMA ADDITIONS:**
```sql
-- New tables created:
events (id, name, event_date, goal, created_by, share_code, timestamps)
athlete_goals (id, athlete_id, event_id, target_workouts, timestamps)

-- Enhanced user_settings:
weekly_workout_frequency INTEGER DEFAULT 4
```

### 🛠️ **NEW DATABASE HELPER FUNCTIONS:**
- `createEvent()` - Create competitions/events with personal goals
- `getUserEvents()` - Get user's created events
- `createGoal()` - Join event and auto-calculate banking targets
