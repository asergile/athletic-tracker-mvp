## 🎨 **Technical Stack (Production):**
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Deployment:** Vercel (configured and working)
- **Performance:** <500KB bundle, <100ms interactions
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript compliance

## 🧪 **Alpha Testing Status:**
**Current State:** Custom activities working perfectly, Goals system ready for integration

**Integration Questions:**
- Will event-driven banking improve engagement vs. generic weekly goals?
- How do custom activities work within the Goals banking system?
- Does the unified system maintain <30s logging speed?

**Success Signals:**
- Users create events with concrete deadlines
- Banking progress motivates consistent logging
- Custom activities work seamlessly within Goals
- "Days remaining" creates urgency
- Logging consistency improves with banking concept

## 📋 **Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete:** Supabase integration with auth and database
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete:** Custom activities database integration
- ✅ **Phase 3 Partial:** Goals system extracted and ready for integration
- 🔄 **Phase 4 In Progress:** Goals + Custom Activities merge (needs completion)
- 🎯 **Phase 5 Next:** Unified system testing and production deployment

## 🎯 **Strategic Position:**
**Strong foundation with working custom activities and extracted Goals functionality. Ready to complete the merge and create the unified solution for alpha testing. Both systems are proven to work independently - integration will provide the complete vision.**

**Next Session Goal:** Complete the Goals + Custom Activities merge and deploy unified solution for comprehensive user testing.

## 🤝 **Development Workflow:**
**Established Protocol:**
1. Problem identification
2. Solution proposal
3. Explicit approval request
4. Implementation only after "Yes, implement this"
5. Local testing before GitHub push
6. User confirmation before deployment

**Goal:** User maintains full control over project direction and testing process.

## 📄 **Session Handoff:**

**For Next Claude Session:** Use the session handoff file created for this session in `project-docs/session-handoffs/` directory.

**Key Files for Next Session:**
- `project-docs/technical-specifications.md` - Technology versions and coding standards (READ FIRST)
- Latest session handoff file - Context for next Claude session
- `working-goals-full.js` - Complete working Goals component
- `project-docs/project-status.md` - This current status document
- Production URL: https://athletic-tracker-kuh17lzh-alain-sergiles-projects.vercel.app

**Goal:** Complete Goals + Custom Activities merge and deploy unified solution for alpha testing.
