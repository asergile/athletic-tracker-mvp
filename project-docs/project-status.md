## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)**

### **1. Domain Propagation & Production Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Monitor DNS propagation for pbgb.ai and pbgb.io domains
- Validate SSL certificate generation and domain redirect functionality
- Test production deployment with custom domain access
- Verify staging environment remains accessible on vercel.app subdomain

### **2. Development Workflow Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Implement disciplined staging → main branch workflow
- Test staging environment for new feature development
- Validate production deployment pipeline from main branch
- Document Git workflow for consistent development process

### **3. History Page Voice Access (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Add voice analysis access buttons to workout cards in history view
- Enable navigation from existing workouts to voice analysis page  
- Add indicators for workouts that have voice notes
- Design consistent UI pattern for accessing voice features

### **4. Multi-Sport Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**  
- Test voice workflow with different sports (running, cycling, etc.)
- Validate transcription accuracy across various workout types
- Test upload performance and error recovery scenarios
- Gather feedback on analysis quality and usefulness

### **5. Alpha User Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Real athlete validation with custom domain URLs
- Test across different devices and browsers
- Collect feedback on analysis accuracy and usefulness
- Identify improvements for different sports/activities

## 🧪 **CURRENT VOICE ANALYSIS TECHNICAL STACK**

### **Voice Processing**
- **Audio Recording:** Browser MediaRecorder API with optimal settings
- **Transcription:** AssemblyAI with speech model 'best', punctuation, formatting
- **Analysis:** Claude Haiku 3 with swimming-specific prompts
- **Storage:** Supabase JSONB column for structured analysis data

### **Integration Architecture**
- **Authentication:** Uses main app's AuthContext pattern
- **Database:** Same Supabase instance, enhanced workouts table
- **APIs:** Standalone /api routes for voice processing
- **Types:** Integrated with main app's TypeScript type system

### **Cost Structure (Production Validated)**
- **AssemblyAI:** $0.0004 per minute of audio
- **Claude Haiku:** $0.0008 per analysis  
- **Total:** $0.0012 per workout analysis
- **Monthly estimate:** 1000 workouts = $1.20

## 🚫 **EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FEATURES**

**These features were intentionally eliminated to maintain MVP focus:**
- ❌ Social features (not core to behavior change)
- ❌ Advanced analytics (beyond weekly stats)
- ❌ Export functionality (not validated need)
- ❌ Complex voice commands (keep simple record → analyze flow)

## 🔄 **WORKFLOW PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED**

**CRITICAL:** Follow established development workflow:
1. Problem identification and analysis
2. Solution proposal with clear rationale  
3. **Explicit approval request** - "Should I implement this fix?"
4. Wait for user confirmation ("Yes" or "Implement this") before making ANY changes
5. Implementation only after explicit approval
6. Local testing and file updates only
7. User handles git operations and deployments manually

**⚠️ NEVER auto-fix issues:** When user shares screenshots, error messages, or describes bugs - this is for discussion ONLY. Always propose solution and ask for approval first.

**Goal:** Maintain user trust and project quality through controlled development process.

## 📄 **Session Handoff:**

**For Next Claude Session:** Use the latest session handoff file: `project-docs/session-handoffs/2025-09-17-production-deployment-setup.md`

**Key Files for Next Session:**
- `project-docs/technical-specifications.md` - Technology versions and coding standards (READ FIRST)
- `project-docs/session-handoffs/2025-09-17-production-deployment-setup.md` - Latest context and priorities
- `src/components/VoiceRecorder.tsx` - Complete voice recording component
- `src/app/voice-analysis/[workoutId]/page.tsx` - Voice analysis page with workout context
- `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` - Main voice analysis pipeline API

**Production URLs:** 
- **Production (Custom Domains):** https://pbgb.ai (primary), https://pbgb.io (redirect)
- **Staging:** https://athletic-tracker-mvp.vercel.app  
- **Production (Vercel):** https://pbgb-production.vercel.app

**Development Workflow:**
- **Local testing** → Push to `staging` branch → Test on staging URL → Merge to `main` → Production deployment

**Goal:** Monitor domain propagation, validate production deployment workflow, then continue with history page voice integration.
