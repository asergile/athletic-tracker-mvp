- **Total:** $0.0012 per workout analysis
- **Monthly estimate:** 1000 workouts = $1.20

## 🔄 **FILES ADDED/MODIFIED THIS SESSION**

### **New API Endpoints**
- `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` - Voice upload and analysis pipeline
- `src/app/api/reanalyze/route.ts` - Transcription editing and re-analysis
- `src/app/api/update-analysis/route.ts` - Manual analysis editing

### **New Components**
- `src/components/VoiceRecorder.tsx` - Complete voice recording component
- `src/app/voice-test/page.tsx` - Full-featured test page with authentication

### **New Utilities**
- `src/lib/audio-utils.ts` - Browser audio recording utilities
- `src/lib/workouts.ts` - Workout database management functions
- `src/lib/supabase-admin.ts` - Server-side Supabase admin client

### **New Types**
- `src/types/voice-workout.ts` - Voice analysis type definitions

### **Database Migration**
- `database/add-voice-analysis.sql` - Adds workout_analysis JSONB column

### **Updated Configuration**
- `package.json` - Added @anthropic-ai/sdk dependency
- `.env.example` - Added ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added VoiceWorkoutAnalysis to Workout interface

## 🚫 **EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FEATURES**

**These features were intentionally eliminated to maintain MVP focus:**
- ❌ Social features (not core to behavior change)
- ❌ Advanced analytics (beyond weekly stats)
- ❌ Export functionality (not validated need)
- ❌ Complex voice commands (keep simple record → analyze flow)

## 🔄 **WORKFLOW PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED**

**CRITICAL:** Follow established development workflow:
1. Problem identification and analysis
2. Solution proposal with clear rationale  
3. **Explicit approval request** - "Should I implement this fix?"
4. Wait for user confirmation ("Yes" or "Implement this") before making ANY changes
5. Implementation only after explicit approval
6. Local testing and file updates only
7. User handles git operations and deployments manually

**⚠️ NEVER auto-fix issues:** When user shares screenshots, error messages, or describes bugs - this is for discussion ONLY. Always propose solution and ask for approval first.

**Goal:** Maintain user trust and project quality through controlled development process.
