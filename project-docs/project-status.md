## 🎨 **Technical Stack (Production):**
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Deployment:** Vercel (configured and working)
- **Performance:** <500KB bundle, <100ms interactions
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript compliance

## 🧪 **Alpha Testing Ready:**
**Primary Question:** Will event-driven banking improve engagement vs. generic weekly goals?

**Success Signals:**
- Users create events with concrete deadlines
- Banking progress motivates consistent logging
- "Days remaining" creates urgency
- Users prefer event targets over generic weekly goals
- Logging consistency improves with banking concept

## 📋 **Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete:** Supabase integration with auth and database
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete:** Event banking system UI and database
- ✅ **User workflows and wireframes:** Implemented and functional
- ✅ **Database schema:** Designed and deployed to production with fixes
- ✅ **Component structure:** Complete and tested locally + production
- ✅ **GitHub Repository:** All changes committed and synced
- ✅ **Session Management System:** Complete handoff protocols established
- ✅ **TypeScript Foundation:** Strict mode compliance achieved
- ✅ **Production Deployment:** Live and working at Vercel
- ✅ **Environment Configuration:** Supabase credentials active
- 🎯 **Current Phase:** Alpha testing scale-up → User feedback collection

## 🎯 **Strategic Position:**
**Event-driven banking addresses the core engagement problem where alpha users abandoned generic weekly goals. The banking concept provides:**
- Concrete deadlines ("State Championships - March 15")
- Visual progress toward specific events
- Multi-event tracking where workouts count toward all goals
- Automatic target calculation based on user's training frequency
- Days remaining countdown creating urgency

**Next Session Goal:** Collect alpha user feedback on banking concept effectiveness vs. traditional goal setting.

## 🤝 **Development Workflow:**
**Established Protocol:**
1. Problem identification
2. Solution proposal
3. Explicit approval request
4. Implementation only after "Yes, implement this"
5. Local testing before GitHub push
6. User confirmation before deployment

**Goal:** User maintains full control over project direction and testing process.

## 📄 **Session Handoff:**

**For Next Claude Session:** Use the most recent session handoff file in `project-docs/session-handoffs/` directory.

**Key Files for Next Session:**
- `project-docs/technical-specifications.md` - Technology versions and coding standards (READ FIRST)
- Latest session handoff file - Context for next Claude session
- `project-docs/project-status.md` - This current status document
- Production URL: https://athletic-tracker-kuh17lzh-alain-sergiles-projects.vercel.app

**Goal:** Collect alpha user feedback on event banking system effectiveness and iterate based on real usage data.
