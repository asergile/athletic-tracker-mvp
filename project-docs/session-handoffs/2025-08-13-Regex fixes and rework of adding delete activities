08/13/25 - Athletic Tracker MVP Handoff Document
PROJECT STATUS
We're adding custom activity management functionality to the user settings page. The app is functional - users can log workouts and add custom activities during workout logging, but we need to complete the profile/settings management features.
COMPLETED TODAY
âœ… Fixed Database Function Calls - Updated all dbHelpers calls to match supabase.js:
* getWorkouts(user.id) â†’ getUserWorkouts()
* addWorkout() â†’ createWorkout()
* Removed user.id parameters from updateUserSettings() calls
* Fixed parameter structure for workout creation
âœ… Improved Success Message - Removed buttons from confirmation modal, added auto-navigation to history after 2 seconds
âœ… Added Handler Functions - Created handleDeleteCustomActivity() and handleAddNewActivityFromProfile() functions
âœ… Added State Variables - Added showAddNewActivity and newActivityName state
CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS
ðŸ”„ Adding Custom Activity Management UI to ProfileView - Need to complete the UI section that shows:
* List of custom activities with delete buttons
* Add new activity form
* Integration with existing handlers
NEXT STEPS NEEDED
1. Update ProfileView component - Add the "CUSTOM ACTIVITIES" section between "DISTANCE UNITS" and "WEEKLY GOAL"
2. Pass new props to ProfileView - Add the new handlers and state to the ProfileView component call
3. Test functionality - Ensure add/delete works from profile page
KEY FILES
* Primary: /src/components/AthleticTracker.js - Main component with all functionality
* Database: /src/lib/supabase.js - Contains correct function signatures
CURRENT ISSUE
The ProfileView component needs the UI added but we couldn't complete the exact text matching for the edit. The functions are ready, just need to:
1. Add the "CUSTOM ACTIVITIES" section HTML to ProfileView
2. Update the ProfileView function signature to accept the new props
3. Update the ProfileView call in the main render to pass the new props
FUNCTION SIGNATURES CONFIRMED WORKING
* dbHelpers.getUserWorkouts() - returns {data: [], error: null}
* dbHelpers.createWorkout(workoutData) - expects {type, duration, rating, date, distance, distance_unit}
* dbHelpers.updateUserSettings(settingsObj) - expects settings object without user.id
USER PREFERENCE NOTED
User prefers brutal honesty and realistic takes over "maybes" and "it can work" responses.
