# Session Ender - Athletic Tracker MVP

**Athletic Tracker MVP - Session Continuation**  
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Session Status:** Weekly Workout Visualization Prototype Complete - Ready for Testing & Integration

## üö® **CRITICAL - READ FIRST:**

**CRITICAL PATH RESTRICTION:**
ONLY read files from: `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/`
NEVER read files from other project directories.
All file references are relative to the athletic-tracker-mvp directory.

**DO NOT BUILD ANYTHING NEW. DO NOT CREATE ANY FILES. DO NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING CODE.**

**The project is STABLE with new prototype ready for testing and integration planning.**

**Current Status:** All code exists at `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/` - Weekly workout visualization prototype complete.

## üß† **WORK-TYPE CONTEXT LOADING:**

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Load documents based on user's work description:

**User says:** "Continue coding - [work description]"
**Your response:** Analyze work type and load appropriate context:

### Context Loading Rules:
- **UI/Component work** (buttons, forms, styling, user experience)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `mvp-requirements.md` + latest handoff
  - Skip: session-log.md, implementation plans

- **Database/Backend work** (schema, APIs, data storage)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `supabase-implementation-plan.md` + latest handoff
  - Skip: session-log.md, UI requirements

- **Bug fixes** (specific error fixing, troubleshooting)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + latest handoff only
  - Skip: All other docs unless bug relates to major architectural decision

- **New features** (adding functionality, architectural changes)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `mvp-requirements.md` + `session-log.md` + latest handoff
  - This is the full context load

- **Planning/Strategy** (rare - user will specify)
  - Load: Everything

### Implementation:
1. User specifies work type in opening message
2. You load only the relevant subset
3. If unclear, ask: "Should I load [MINIMAL|STANDARD|FULL] context for this work?"
4. Only request additional docs if you encounter missing context during work

## üéØ **CONTEXT:** 
We successfully created a standalone WeeklyWorkoutView component that provides an interactive calendar visualization of weekly workouts. The component features day indicators (üí™ for workout days, circles with numbers for non-workout days), week navigation, and workout cards organized by day. This prototype is ready for testing at `/weekly-view` route and will eventually replace the existing stats cards in both the history and log workout views.

## ‚úÖ **WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED THIS SESSION:**

* **üìÖ Complete Weekly View Component:** Built WeeklyWorkoutView.js with full interactive calendar functionality
* **üí™ Smart Day Indicators:** Implemented flexed arm icons for workout days and numbered circles for non-workout days
* **üóìÔ∏è Week Navigation System:** Added previous/next week navigation with restriction against future dates past today
* **üì± Interactive Calendar:** Tap day indicators to scroll automatically to workout cards for that day
* **üé® Consistent Visual Design:** Used same glassmorphism styling and gradient backgrounds as existing components
* **üöÄ Standalone Testing Page:** Created `/weekly-view` route for isolated testing and development
* **üìä Data Integration:** Properly integrated with existing workout data and database helpers
* **üìñ Documentation Updates:** Updated project-status.md with new weekly visualization features
