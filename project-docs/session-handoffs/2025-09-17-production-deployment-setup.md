# Session Handoff - Production Deployment Infrastructure Setup

**Athletic Tracker MVP - Session Continuation**  
**Date:** September 17, 2025  
**Session Status:** Production deployment infrastructure established with custom domains

## üö® **CRITICAL - READ FIRST:**

**CRITICAL PATH RESTRICTION:**
ONLY read files from: `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/`
NEVER read files from other project directories.
All file references are relative to the athletic-tracker-mvp directory.

**DO NOT BUILD ANYTHING NEW. DO NOT CREATE ANY FILES. DO NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING CODE.**

**The project is 100% COMPLETE and ready for production deployment validation.**

**Current Status:** Production deployment infrastructure established - domains propagating, staging workflow implemented.

## üß† **WORK-TYPE CONTEXT LOADING:**

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Load documents based on user's work description:

**User says:** "Continue coding - [work description]"
**Your response:** Analyze work type and load appropriate context:

### Context Loading Rules:
- **Deployment/Infrastructure work** (domains, staging, production, DNS, Vercel)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `deployment-guide.md` + latest handoff
  - Skip: UI requirements, database plans unless deployment-related

- **UI/Component work** (buttons, forms, styling, user experience)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `mvp-requirements.md` + latest handoff
  - Skip: session-log.md, implementation plans, technical-specifications.md

- **Bug fixes** (specific error fixing, troubleshooting)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + latest handoff only
  - Skip: All other docs unless bug relates to major architectural decision

- **New features** (adding functionality, architectural changes)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `mvp-requirements.md` + `technical-specifications.md` + latest handoff
  - This is the standard context load

### Implementation:
1. User specifies work type in opening message
2. You load only the relevant subset
3. If unclear, ask: "Should I load [MINIMAL|STANDARD|FULL] context for this work?"
4. Only request additional docs if you encounter missing context during work

## üéØ **CONTEXT:**

We just completed the production deployment infrastructure setup for the Athletic Tracker MVP. **The application was already fully functional with complete voice integration** - this session focused solely on establishing proper deployment methodology with custom domains and staging/production environments.

## ‚úÖ **WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED THIS SESSION:**

* **Custom Domain Registration:** Secured pbgb.ai and pbgb.io through Hover registrar
* **Production Deployment Strategy:** pbgb.ai as primary domain, pbgb.io redirects for unified branding  
* **Dual Environment Setup:** Created separate Vercel projects for staging and production
* **Git Workflow Implementation:** Established staging branch ‚Üí main branch deployment pipeline
* **DNS Configuration:** Configured A records pointing to Vercel infrastructure (76.76.19.61)
* **Environment Variables:** Properly configured production environment with Supabase and API keys
* **Documentation Updates:** Updated project-status.md and deployment-guide.md to reflect new infrastructure

## üìç **CURRENT PROJECT STATUS:**
* **Location:** `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp` (PROJECT EXISTS - DO NOT RECREATE)
* **Git:** User handles all git operations manually (push, commit, etc.)
* **Status:** Production infrastructure established, DNS propagating (15 min - 2 hours)
* **Architecture:** React + Supabase + Tailwind + Voice Integration (Complete)
* **Core Value:** "Log your workout in under 30 seconds. See your progress instantly." + AI voice analysis

## üö´ **WHAT NOT TO DO:**
- **DO NOT** create any new project files or directories
- **DO NOT** run any setup workflows or initialization scripts  
- **DO NOT** implement new features until deployment validation complete
- **DO NOT** overwrite existing code in `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/`
- **DO NOT** perform any git operations (user handles git workflow manually)

## üë®‚Äçüíª **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:**
**Act as a seasoned DevOps architect with production deployment experience.**

- **Monitor deployment health:** Check domain propagation, SSL certificates, redirects
- **Validate workflow:** Ensure staging ‚Üí production pipeline works correctly
- **Assess infrastructure risks:** DNS issues, certificate problems, deployment failures
- **Document process:** Clear instructions for ongoing development workflow
- **User impact:** Ensure smooth transition to custom domain without user disruption
- **Be direct:** Honest about DNS propagation times and potential issues

## ‚úÖ **WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:**
1. **FIRST: Read technical specifications** - `project-docs/technical-specifications.md`
2. **Acknowledge** that production deployment infrastructure is established
3. **Monitor** domain propagation status and help troubleshoot any DNS issues
4. **Validate** that staging/production workflow functions correctly  
5. **Help user** test the new custom domain functionality when live
6. **Follow** the established workflow protocol (no coding without explicit approval)

## üî• **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (Priority Order):

1. **Domain Propagation Monitoring** - Check DNS propagation for pbgb.ai and pbgb.io
2. **Production Validation** - Test custom domain access and SSL certificates
3. **Staging Workflow Testing** - Validate staging branch deployment functionality
4. **Development Process Documentation** - Ensure Git workflow is clearly understood
5. **History Page Voice Integration** - Continue feature development using new staging workflow

**NO NEW CODE DEVELOPMENT NEEDED - ONLY DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION AND TESTING**

## üéØ **NEXT SESSION WORK TYPE:**
**Likely work:** DEPLOYMENT/INFRASTRUCTURE or UI/COMPONENT (history page)
**Context needed:** MINIMAL for deployment validation, STANDARD for new features
**Specific focus:** DNS propagation monitoring and staging workflow validation

**Suggested opening:** "Continue with deployment validation - check domain propagation status"

## üìä **KEY METRICS & SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
**Deployment Success Measures:**
- pbgb.ai domain loading application successfully - **PENDING DNS**
- pbgb.io redirecting to pbgb.ai correctly - **PENDING DNS**
- SSL certificates auto-generated by Vercel - **PENDING DOMAIN**
- Staging environment accessible at athletic-tracker-mvp.vercel.app - **ACTIVE**
- Production deployment pipeline functional - **CONFIGURED**

## üë§ **USER PREFERENCES & CONTEXT:**
- **User Preference:** "I prefer brutal honesty and realistic takes over being led down paths of maybes"
- **PM Background:** 20+ years bringing ideas to life 0-to-1, strong product sense
- **Technical Comfort:** Can handle DNS configuration and deployment testing
- **Project Philosophy:** Disciplined deployment workflow prevents production issues
- **Goal:** Professional custom domain presence for alpha testing and user acquisition

## üìÅ **COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:**
Essential files to review in `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/project-docs/`:
* `technical-specifications.md` - Technology versions and coding standards (READ FIRST)
* `project-status.md` - Updated with production deployment status
* `deployment-guide.md` - Updated with staging/production workflow
* `mvp-requirements.md` - Complete feature specifications
* `session-log.md` - Decision history and strategic pivots
* `alpha-testing-protocol.md` - User testing strategy  

**Additional Key Files:**
* `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Configuration guide
* `SESSION_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` - Template for future handoffs

## üîÑ **WORKFLOW PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED:**
**CRITICAL:** Follow established development workflow:
1. Problem identification and analysis
2. Solution proposal with clear rationale
3. **Explicit approval request** - "Should I implement this fix?"
4. Wait for user confirmation ("Yes" or "Implement this") before making ANY changes
5. Implementation only after explicit approval
6. **Use staging branch for all development** - NO direct main branch changes
7. User handles git operations and deployments manually

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER auto-fix issues:** When user shares screenshots, error messages, or describes bugs - this is for discussion ONLY. Always propose solution and ask for approval first.

**Goal:** User maintains full control over production deployment and maintains deployment discipline.

## üöÄ **PROJECT MOMENTUM:**
**Strategic Position:** We've successfully established professional production deployment infrastructure with custom domains that clearly brand the Personal Best Goal Buddy application. The staging/production workflow ensures safe development practices as we move toward alpha testing with real athletes.

**Next Session Goal:** Validate production deployment functionality and continue feature development using proper staging workflow.
