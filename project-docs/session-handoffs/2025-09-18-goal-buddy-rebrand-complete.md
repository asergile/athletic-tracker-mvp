## üß† **WORK-TYPE CONTEXT LOADING:**

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Load documents based on user's work description:

**User says:** "Continue coding - [work description]"
**Your response:** Analyze work type and load appropriate context:

### Context Loading Rules:
- **Alpha User Testing** (user feedback, testing protocol, analytics)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `alpha-testing-protocol.md` + latest handoff
  - Skip: session-log.md, implementation plans

- **Apple OAuth Implementation** (adding Apple Sign-In)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `technical-specifications.md` + latest handoff
  - Skip: All other docs unless major architectural decision needed

- **Brand/UI Updates** (refining Goal Buddy branding, UX improvements)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `mvp-requirements.md` + latest handoff
  - Skip: session-log.md, technical implementation details

- **DO NOT** overwrite existing Goal Buddy branding without understanding strategic context
- **DO NOT** overwrite existing code in `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/`
- **DO NOT** perform any git operations (user handles git workflow manually)

## üë®‚Äçüíª **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:**
**Act as a seasoned product manager and authentication specialist with OAuth expertise.**

- **Strategic thinking:** Consider brand alignment with long-term goals-focused platform vision
- **Authentication expertise:** Understand OAuth provider integration and user experience implications
- **Brand consistency:** Maintain Goal Buddy identity across all user touchpoints
- **User experience focus:** Prioritize authentication friction reduction and conversion optimization
- **Production mindset:** Consider multi-environment deployment and testing requirements
- **Be direct:** Honest about authentication complexity and branding trade-offs
- **Document rationale:** Explain WHY brand and authentication decisions were made

## ‚úÖ **WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:**
1. **FIRST: Read technical specifications** - `project-docs/technical-specifications.md`
2. **Understand rebrand completion** - Goal Buddy brand successfully deployed to production
3. **Support alpha testing preparation** - Help prepare for real athlete validation with new branding  
4. **Plan Apple OAuth integration** - Consider adding Apple Sign-In to complete OAuth provider coverage
5. **Strategic planning support** - Help plan Phase 2 voice integration return when user base validated
6. **Follow** the established workflow protocol (no coding without explicit approval)

## üî• **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (Priority Order):

1. **Alpha User Testing with Goal Buddy Brand** - Begin real athlete validation with professional branding and Google OAuth
2. **Brand Reception Monitoring** - Track user feedback on Goal Buddy messaging and authentication preferences
3. **Apple OAuth Planning** - Prepare for Apple Sign-In integration to eliminate password dependency entirely
4. **Strategic Architecture Planning** - Plan goals + events separation when success metrics achieved
5. **Phase 2 Voice Integration Planning** - Prepare for voice processing return when user adoption validated

**GOAL BUDDY REBRAND IS 100% COMPLETE - READY FOR ALPHA USER VALIDATION**

## üéØ **NEXT SESSION WORK TYPE:**
**Likely work:** ALPHA_USER_TESTING or APPLE_OAUTH_IMPLEMENTATION  
**Context needed:** STANDARD for alpha testing, MINIMAL for Apple OAuth implementation
**Specific focus:** Real athlete validation with Goal Buddy brand or OAuth provider expansion

**Suggested opening:** "Continue with Goal Buddy alpha testing preparation" or "Continue with Apple OAuth implementation"

## üìä **KEY METRICS & SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
**Goal Buddy Brand Success Measures:**
- Google OAuth vs email/password adoption rates - Track authentication preferences
- User feedback on "Track progress. Smash goals." messaging resonance - Validate strategic positioning
- Brand recognition and trust indicators - Professional appearance impact
- Authentication friction reduction - Conversion improvement measurement
- Alpha user onboarding success rates - End-to-end experience validation

**Next Phase Targets:**
- Apple OAuth integration completion - Complete OAuth provider coverage
- Phase 2 voice integration readiness - Architecture prepared for user base growth
- Goals + events separation planning - Strategic architecture evolution when metrics achieved

## üë§ **USER PREFERENCES & CONTEXT:**
- **User Preference:** "I prefer brutal honesty and realistic takes over being led down paths of maybes"
- **PM Background:** 20+ years bringing ideas to life 0-to-1, strong product sense
- **Technical Comfort:** Has Google Cloud Console access, can handle OAuth configuration
- **Project Philosophy:** Strategic sequencing over feature complexity
- **Goal:** Validate Goal Buddy brand with athletes while maintaining superior authentication experience

## üìÅ **COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:**
Essential files to review in `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/project-docs/`:
* `technical-specifications.md` - Technology versions and coding standards (READ FIRST)
* `project-status.md` - Updated with Goal Buddy rebrand completion status
* `STRATEGIC_EVOLUTION_CONTEXT.md` - Strategic context for Phase 2 voice processing return
* `product-strategy-roadmap-business-model-evolution.md` - Goals + events separation planning
* `alpha-testing-protocol.md` - User testing strategy with Goal Buddy brand
* `mvp-requirements.md` - Complete feature specifications

## üîÑ **WORKFLOW PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED:**
**CRITICAL:** Follow established development workflow:
1. Problem identification and analysis
2. Solution proposal with clear rationale
3. **Explicit approval request** - "Should I implement this OAuth improvement?"
4. Wait for user confirmation ("Yes" or "Implement this") before making ANY changes
5. Implementation only after explicit approval
6. Use staging branch for all development
7. User handles git operations and deployments manually

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER auto-fix issues:** When user shares screenshots, error messages, or describes bugs - this is for discussion ONLY. Always propose solution and ask for approval first.

**Goal:** User maintains full control over Goal Buddy brand evolution and production deployment.

## üöÄ **PROJECT MOMENTUM:**
**Strategic Position:** We've successfully completed the Goal Buddy rebrand with working Google OAuth authentication, positioning the platform for strategic evolution toward the goals-focused architecture. The professional branding creates trust and the superior authentication experience reduces friction for alpha user adoption.

**Next Session Goal:** Begin alpha user testing with Goal Buddy brand or expand OAuth provider coverage with Apple Sign-In.
