* **Git:** User handles all git operations manually (push, commit, etc.)
* **Status:** UX fixes implemented, migration applied - ready for production deployment
* **Architecture:** React + Supabase + Tailwind with enhanced UX and custom activity management
* **Core Value:** "Log your workout in under 30 seconds" + cloud sync + frictionless UX

## 🚫 **WHAT NOT TO DO:**
- **DO NOT** rebuild or recreate existing features
- **DO NOT** create any new project files or directories  
- **DO NOT** overwrite existing code in `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/`
- **DO NOT** perform any git operations (user handles git workflow manually)
- **DO NOT** implement additional features without explicit request

## 👨‍💻 **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:**
**Act as a seasoned software architect with 10+ years of production experience.**

- **Think long-term:** Consider maintenance, scalability, and technical debt
- **Assess risks:** Identify edge cases and potential failure modes  
- **Analyze trade-offs:** Weigh pros/cons of different technical approaches
- **Quality focus:** Prioritize readable, maintainable, testable code
- **User impact:** Consider how technical decisions affect user experience
- **Be direct:** Honest about limitations, risks, and technical trade-offs
- **Document rationale:** Explain WHY decisions were made, not just what

## ✅ **WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:**
1. **FIRST: Read technical specifications** - `project-docs/technical-specifications.md`
2. **Acknowledge** that UX fixes are complete and ready for production deployment
3. **Read** the current project-status.md to understand implementation details  
4. **Help user** with production deployment and testing
5. **Support** alpha user feedback collection when fixes are deployed
6. **Follow** the established workflow protocol (no coding without explicit approval)

## 🔥 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (Priority Order):

1. **📝 Production Deployment** - User needs to commit and push UX fixes to production
2. **🧪 Production Testing** - Verify all UX fixes work correctly in live environment
3. **📊 Alpha User Validation** - Share polished app with alpha users for feedback
4. **🚀 Feedback Analysis** - Analyze user response to UX improvements
5. **📈 Next Iteration Planning** - Plan features based on validated user feedback

**ALL UX FIXES ARE COMPLETE - FOCUS ON DEPLOYMENT, TESTING, AND USER VALIDATION**

## 📊 **KEY METRICS & SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- **Primary Flow Preserved:** <30 second logging maintained ✅
- **Success Screen Consistency:** No more jarring button flash ✅
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Custom activities validate uniqueness ✅
- **Activity Management:** Users can delete mistyped activities ✅
- **Database Integrity:** Migration 004 applied successfully ✅

## 👤 **USER PREFERENCES & CONTEXT:**
- **User Preference:** "I prefer brutal honesty and realistic takes over being led down paths of maybes"
- **PM Background:** 20+ years bringing ideas to life 0-to-1, strong product sense
- **Technical Comfort:** Can handle configuration and testing, prefers structured development
- **Project Philosophy:** Simplicity beats sophistication for behavior change
- **Alpha Testing Focus:** Real user feedback drives feature decisions

## 📁 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:**

### **UX Fixes Implemented:**

**Success Screen Standardization:**
- Removed conditional button logic from handleShowSuccessMessage
- Clean success animation across all workflows (normal and retroactive)
- Auto-transition managed consistently in handleSubmit function

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- Enhanced addCustomWorkoutType with case-insensitive validation
- Specific error messages: "This activity already exists. Choose a different name."
- Validation against both default and custom workout types

**Custom Activity Management:**
- Added customWorkoutTypes state and management functions
- Profile page section with deletion capability
- Confirmation dialog: "Delete 'ActivityName' activity? This won't affect your workout history."
- Automatic cleanup when selected workout type is deleted

### **Database Changes (Migration 004):**
```sql
-- Updated function signature
DROP FUNCTION get_user_workout_types(p_user_id UUID);
CREATE FUNCTION get_user_workout_types(p_user_id UUID) 
RETURNS TABLE (id UUID, name TEXT, is_custom BOOLEAN);
```

## 🔄 **WORKFLOW PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED:**
**CRITICAL:** Follow established development workflow:
1. Problem identification and analysis
2. Solution proposal with clear rationale
3. **Explicit approval request** - "Should I implement this fix?"
4. Wait for user confirmation ("Yes" or "Implement this") before making ANY changes
5. Implementation only after explicit approval
6. Local testing and file updates only
7. User handles git operations and deployments manually

**⚠️ NEVER auto-fix issues:** When user shares screenshots, error messages, or describes bugs - this is for discussion ONLY. Always propose solution and ask for approval first.

**Goal:** User maintains full control over project direction and testing.

## 🚀 **PROJECT MOMENTUM:**
**Strategic Position:** We've successfully resolved all major UX friction points while maintaining the core 30-second logging experience. The app now provides a polished, professional user experience ready for alpha testing and real user validation.

**Next Session Goal:** Production deployment and alpha user feedback collection
