**Athletic Tracker MVP - Session Continuation**  
**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Session Status:** Goal Creation Enhanced for College Athletes - Production Ready

## üö® **CRITICAL - READ FIRST:**

**CRITICAL PATH RESTRICTION:**
ONLY read files from: `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/`
NEVER read files from other project directories.
All file references are relative to the athletic-tracker-mvp directory.

**DO NOT BUILD ANYTHING NEW. DO NOT CREATE ANY FILES. DO NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING CODE.**

**The project is STABLE and ready for continued feature development and testing.**

**Current Status:** All code exists at `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/` - Goal creation enhanced for college athletes.

## üß† **WORK-TYPE CONTEXT LOADING:**

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Load documents based on user's work description:

**User says:** "Continue coding - [work description]"
**Your response:** Analyze work type and load appropriate context:

### Context Loading Rules:
- **UI/Component work** (buttons, forms, styling, user experience)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `mvp-requirements.md` + latest handoff
  - Skip: session-log.md, implementation plans

- **Database/Backend work** (schema, APIs, data storage)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `supabase-implementation-plan.md` + latest handoff
  - Skip: session-log.md, UI requirements

- **Bug fixes** (specific error fixing, troubleshooting)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + latest handoff only
  - Skip: All other docs unless bug relates to major architectural decision

- **New features** (adding functionality, architectural changes)
  - Load: `project-status.md` + `mvp-requirements.md` + `session-log.md` + latest handoff
  - This is the full context load

- **Planning/Strategy** (rare - user will specify)
  - Load: Everything

### Implementation:
1. User specifies work type in opening message
2. You load only the relevant subset
3. If unclear, ask: "Should I load [MINIMAL|STANDARD|FULL] context for this work?"
4. Only request additional docs if you encounter missing context during work

## üéØ **CONTEXT:** 
We enhanced the goal creation form to better serve college athletes by expanding the weekly workout frequency range and simplifying the interface. The app maintains its core value proposition of sub-30-second workout logging with intelligent goal tracking that supports serious training programs.

## ‚úÖ **WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED THIS SESSION:**

* **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Expanded Weekly Workout Range:** Changed goal creation from 3-6 workouts/week to 1-21 workouts/week to support college athletes who train multiple times daily
* **üéØ Removed Redundant Sport Selection:** Eliminated the sport dropdown since activity types are already tracked through workout logging
* **üì± Improved Form Layout:** Converted from 2-column grid to single full-width field with better labeling and help text
* **üí™ College Athlete Ready:** Now supports realistic training volumes for serious athletes (14-21 workouts/week)
* **‚ú® Enhanced UX:** Added proper singular/plural grammar and descriptive help text for workout frequency selection
* **üöÄ Production Deployed:** Changes pushed to main branch via git and deployed to Vercel automatically

## üìç **CURRENT PROJECT STATUS:**
* **Location:** `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp` (PROJECT EXISTS - DO NOT RECREATE)
* **Git:** User handles all git operations manually (push, commit, etc.)
* **Status:** Goal creation enhanced and production-ready, all core features functional
* **Architecture:** React + Supabase + Tailwind (NO voice processing, NO LLM integration)

2. Solution proposal with clear rationale
3. **Explicit approval request** - "Should I implement this fix?"
4. Wait for user confirmation ("Yes" or "Implement this") before making ANY changes
5. Implementation only after explicit approval
6. Local testing and file updates only
7. User handles git operations and deployments manually

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER auto-fix issues:** When user shares screenshots, error messages, or describes bugs - this is for discussion ONLY. Always propose solution and ask for approval first.

**Goal:** User maintains full control over project direction and testing.

## üöÄ **PROJECT MOMENTUM:**
**Strategic Position:** Successfully enhanced goal creation to support college athletes training 14-21 times per week. The app now serves both recreational users (1-3 workouts/week) and serious athletes (15-21 workouts/week) while maintaining the core simplicity that drives adoption. Ready for comprehensive alpha testing with diverse athlete populations.

**Next Session Goal:** Continue feature development, testing, or alpha user feedback incorporation.

---

**Start your next session by saying:** "Continue with Athletic Tracker MVP - I understand the goal creation has been enhanced for college athletes and is ready for testing or additional feature development."

**FIRST ACTION:** 
1. Analyze user's work description to determine context needed
2. Load appropriate document subset based on work type
3. Only read additional docs if context gaps emerge during work

---

**KEY TECHNICAL INSIGHT:** The goal creation enhancement involved expanding the weekly workout frequency from a hardcoded 3-6 range to a dynamic 1-21 range using `Array.from({length: 21}, (_, i) => i + 1)`. This simple change dramatically improves the app's utility for college athletes who often train 2-3 times per day, while the removal of the redundant sport dropdown simplifies the interface since activity types are already captured during workout logging.
