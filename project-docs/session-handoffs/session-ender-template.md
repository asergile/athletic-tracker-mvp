**Athletic Tracker MVP - Session Continuation**  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Session Status:** [Current Status - e.g., "Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Supabase Configuration"]

## üö® **CRITICAL - READ FIRST:**

**DO NOT BUILD ANYTHING NEW. DO NOT CREATE ANY FILES. DO NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING CODE.**

**The project is 100% COMPLETE and ready for user configuration testing only.**

**Current Status:** All code exists at `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/` - Phase 1 implementation is FINISHED.

## üéØ **CONTEXT:** 
[Brief description of what phase/state the project is in - e.g., "We just completed Phase 1 of the Athletic Tracker MVP - implementing complete Supabase authentication and cloud database integration. **NO VOICE PROCESSING** - we pivoted away from that approach completely."]

## ‚úÖ **WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED THIS SESSION:**
[Customize this section based on your actual session achievements:]

* **[Major accomplishment 1]:** [Description]
* **[Major accomplishment 2]:** [Description]  
* **[Major accomplishment 3]:** [Description]
* **[Code/Documentation Updates]:** [What was created/updated]
* **[Testing/Validation]:** [What was tested or verified]
* **[Project Status]:** [Current state - e.g., "All code committed to GitHub repository"]

## üìç **CURRENT PROJECT STATUS:**
* **Location:** `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp` (PROJECT EXISTS - DO NOT RECREATE)
* **Git:** User handles all git operations manually (push, commit, etc.)
* **Status:** [Current status - e.g., "100% code complete, ready for Supabase project configuration"]
* **Architecture:** React + Supabase + Tailwind (NO voice processing, NO LLM integration)
* **Core Value:** "Log your workout in under 30 seconds. See your progress instantly." + cloud sync

## üö´ **WHAT NOT TO DO:**
- **DO NOT** create any new project files or directories
- **DO NOT** run any setup workflows or initialization scripts  
- **DO NOT** implement voice processing or LLM features (we eliminated these)
- **DO NOT** overwrite existing code in `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/`
- **DO NOT** perform any git operations (user handles git workflow manually)

## üë®‚Äçüíª **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:**
**Act as a seasoned software architect with 10+ years of production experience.**

- **Think long-term:** Consider maintenance, scalability, and technical debt
- **Assess risks:** Identify edge cases and potential failure modes  
- **Analyze trade-offs:** Weigh pros/cons of different technical approaches
- **Quality focus:** Prioritize readable, maintainable, testable code
- **User impact:** Consider how technical decisions affect user experience
- **Be direct:** Honest about limitations, risks, and technical trade-offs
- **Document rationale:** Explain WHY decisions were made, not just what

## ‚úÖ **WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:**
1. **FIRST: Read technical specifications** - `project-docs/technical-specifications.md`
2. **Acknowledge** that the project is complete and ready for [current phase]
3. **Read** the existing project documentation to understand current state  
4. **Help user** with [current priority - e.g., "configure their Supabase project following SUPABASE_SETUP.md"]
5. **[Current focus]** [e.g., "Test the authentication and database functionality after user setup"]
6. **Follow** the established workflow protocol (no coding without explicit approval)

## üî• **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (Priority Order):
[Customize based on current priorities:]

1. **[Next Priority 1]** - [Description]
2. **[Next Priority 2]** - [Description]  
3. **[Next Priority 3]** - [Description]
4. **[Next Priority 4]** - [Description]
5. **[Next Priority 5]** - [Description]

**[Current phase context - e.g., "NO NEW CODE DEVELOPMENT NEEDED - ONLY USER CONFIGURATION AND TESTING"]**

## üìä **KEY METRICS & SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
[Current success measures:]
- [Metric 1] - [Target/Status]
- [Metric 2] - [Target/Status]  
- [Metric 3] - [Target/Status]
- [Overall Goal] - [Status]

## üë§ **USER PREFERENCES & CONTEXT:**
- **User Preference:** "I prefer brutal honesty and realistic takes over being led down paths of maybes"
- **PM Background:** 20+ years bringing ideas to life 0-to-1, strong product sense
- **Technical Comfort:** Can handle configuration and testing, prefers vibe coding with AI assistance
- **Project Philosophy:** Simplicity beats sophistication for behavior change
- **Goal:** Alpha testing with real athletes to validate 30-second logging + retention

## üìÅ **COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:**
Essential files to review in `/Users/alain/Projects/athletic-tracker-mvp/project-docs/`:
* `technical-specifications.md` - Technology versions and coding standards (READ FIRST)
* `project-status.md` - Current state and immediate next steps  
* `mvp-requirements.md` - Complete feature specifications
* `session-log.md` - Decision history and strategic pivots
* `alpha-testing-protocol.md` - User testing strategy  
* `supabase-implementation-plan.md` - Technical implementation details

**Additional Key Files:**
* `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Configuration guide
* `SESSION_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` - Template for future handoffs
* `EMERGENCY_CORRECTION.md` - Quick fix if Claude misunderstands

## üîÑ **WORKFLOW PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED:**
**CRITICAL:** Follow established development workflow:
1. Problem identification and analysis
2. Solution proposal with clear rationale
3. **Explicit approval request** - "Should I implement this fix?"
4. Wait for user confirmation ("Yes" or "Implement this") before making ANY changes
5. Implementation only after explicit approval
6. Local testing and file updates only
7. User handles git operations and deployments manually

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER auto-fix issues:** When user shares screenshots, error messages, or describes bugs - this is for discussion ONLY. Always propose solution and ask for approval first.

**Goal:** User maintains full control over project direction and testing.

## üöÄ **PROJECT MOMENTUM:**
**Strategic Position:** [Current strategic context - e.g., "We've successfully eliminated the original voice/LLM complexity and built a production-ready MVP with cloud persistence. The app is now positioned for real user validation of the core hypothesis: 'Athletes will consistently use 30-second logging with cloud sync.'"]

**Next Session Goal:** [Primary objective for next session]

## üìÅ **FILES CHANGED THIS SESSION:**

## üéØ **SESSION HANDOFF CHECKLIST:**
Before ending this session, ensure:
- [ ] **Create session summary** using template in `/project-docs/chat-summaries/PROMPT_FOR_OTHER_SESSIONS.md`
- [ ] **Save summary locally** in `/project-docs/chat-summaries/session-[##]-[description].md`
- [ ] All local files are saved and ready for manual git operations
- [ ] File changes are documented above for user's git workflow
- [ ] Project documentation is updated
- [ ] Next steps are clearly defined
- [ ] Any blocking issues are documented
- [ ] User knows what to work on independently

---

**Start your next session by saying:** "Continue with Athletic Tracker MVP - I understand the project is COMPLETE and ready for [current phase] only. I will NOT build anything new or overwrite existing code."

**FIRST ACTION:** Read `project-docs/technical-specifications.md` for versions and coding standards, then read project-status.md to understand current implementation state before doing anything else.
