# Product Strategy, Roadmap & Business Model Evolution

**Athletic Tracker MVP - Strategic Planning Document**  
**Created:** August 14, 2025  
**Last Updated:** August 14, 2025  
**Status:** Strategic Planning & Conceptual Development

---

## 🎯 **Current Product Position**

### **Validated Core Value Proposition:**
**"Log your workout in under 30 seconds. See your progress instantly."**

- **Target User:** Serious athletes training for specific events/competitions
- **Core Behavior:** Friction-free workout logging with immediate visual progress
- **Key Differentiator:** Simplicity over sophistication for behavior change
- **Current State:** Unified Goals + Custom Activities system deployed and ready for alpha testing

### **Current Architecture (MVP):**
- **Individual athlete focus:** Personal workout tracking and goal setting
- **Personal events:** Athletes create their own "State Championships - March 15" entries
- **Work banking concept:** Sessions/hours banked toward personal deadlines
- **Custom activities:** Sport-specific workout types in personal database

---

## 🔄 **Strategic Evolution: Events vs Goals Separation**

### **Current Problem with MVP Architecture:**
- **Events and Goals are conflated:** "State Championships" (event) + "Swim PB in freestyle" (goal) treated as single entity
- **Limited scalability:** No shared events, no team/coach coordination
- **Monetization constraints:** Individual-only model limits revenue potential

### **Proposed Conceptual Separation:**

#### **Events (Shared Entities):**
- **Definition:** Competitions, meets, races with fixed dates
- **Examples:** "State Championships - March 15, 2025", "Regional Marathon - April 20, 2025"
- **Ownership:** Can be created by coaches, clubs, organizations, or individuals
- **Shareable:** Multiple athletes can "register" for the same event

#### **Goals (Personal Entities):**
- **Definition:** What an individual athlete wants to achieve AT a specific event
- **Examples:** "Swim PB in 100 freestyle", "Break 3:00 marathon", "Make finals in 50 free"
- **Ownership:** Always personal to the athlete
- **Privacy Control:** Athlete chooses whether to share with coach/team/public

#### **Work Banking Remains Core:**
- "45 sessions banked toward **State Championships**"
- "Goal: **Swim PB in 100 freestyle**"
- "38 days remaining"

## 🚀 **Future Feature Vision: Coach/Club Platform**

### **QR Code Event Creation Feature:**

#### **Coach Workflow:**
1. Coach creates shared event: "Spring Invitational - May 10, 2025"
2. System generates unique QR code for the event
3. Coach shares QR code (print, email, team chat, etc.)
4. Coach dashboard shows who's registered for the event
5. Coach can optionally see athlete goals (if athletes choose to share)

#### **Athlete Workflow:**
1. Athlete scans QR code on phone
2. Event auto-populates in their app: "Spring Invitational - May 10, 2025"
3. Athlete sets personal goal: "Drop 2 seconds in 200 IM"
4. Athlete chooses privacy: Share goal with coach? Keep private? Share publicly?
5. Work banking begins immediately: "0 of 35 sessions banked toward Spring Invitational"

#### **Technical Requirements:**
- QR code generation and management
- Shared events database table
- Coach/organization accounts and dashboards
- Privacy controls for goal sharing
- Team management interface

## 💰 **Monetization Strategy Evolution**

### **Current Model (Free):**
- Individual athlete accounts
- Personal event/goal creation
- Basic work banking and progress tracking
- Custom activities management

### **Proposed Tiered Model:**

#### **Free Tier (Individual Athletes):**
- Personal workout logging and tracking
- Create personal events and goals
- Basic work banking toward deadlines
- Custom activities
- Join events via QR codes (created by others)

#### **Coach/Club Tier (Subscription - $X/month):**
- Create shared events with QR codes
- Team dashboard showing event registrations
- See athlete goals (with permission)
- Team progress analytics
- Bulk event management
- Export capabilities

#### **Organization Tier (Higher subscription):**
- Multiple coaches/administrators
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Custom branding on shared events
- Integration capabilities
- Priority support

### **Revenue Potential:**
- **Swim clubs:** 50+ athletes per club, coach pays for team management
- **Running clubs:** Group marathon training coordination
- **School teams:** Coach manages multiple events per season
- **Training groups:** Shared accountability and progress tracking

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture Implications**

### **Database Schema Evolution:**

#### **Current MVP Schema:**
```
events: {id, user_id, name, event_date, goal, created_at}
athlete_goals: {id, user_id, event_id, target_workouts, ...}
```

#### **Future Schema (Events/Goals Separated):**
```
shared_events: {id, name, event_date, created_by, organization_id, qr_code, ...}
athlete_event_registrations: {id, user_id, event_id, registered_at, ...}
athlete_goals: {id, user_id, event_id, goal_description, shared_with_coach, ...}
organizations: {id, name, subscription_tier, ...}
organization_members: {id, organization_id, user_id, role, ...}
```

### **Key Technical Challenges:**
- **Data migration:** Transitioning current personal events to new model
- **QR code infrastructure:** Generation, scanning, security
- **Multi-tenancy:** Coach accounts vs. athlete accounts
- **Privacy controls:** Granular sharing permissions
- **Billing integration:** Subscription management and payment processing

## 🤔 **Open Strategic Questions**

### **Product Strategy:**
1. How much complexity can we add while maintaining the "30-second logging" core value?
2. Should shared events be sport-specific or universal?
3. What privacy controls do athletes really want vs. what coaches need?
4. How do we handle athletes who train for multiple sports/coaches?

### **Business Model:**
1. What's the right price point for coach subscriptions?
2. Should we target individual coaches or athletic organizations?
3. How do we balance free features vs. paid features without alienating individual athletes?
4. What's our customer acquisition strategy for the coach market?

### **Technical:**
1. How do we ensure scalability as we move from individual to team-based features?
2. What's our approach to data privacy and compliance (COPPA for youth athletes)?
3. How do we handle international markets with different sports calendars?
4. What integrations would provide the most value (race timing systems, team management platforms)?
