# TypeScript Fix Applied

Fixed conflicting Workout type definitions:
- Updated `/lib/workouts.ts` to use `rating: 1 | 2 | 3` instead of `rating: number`
- Removed duplicate Workout interface from voice-analysis page
- Added proper import for Workout type

This resolves the deployment error:
> Type 'import("/vercel/path0/src/lib/workouts").Workout' is not assignable to parameter of type 'SetStateAction<Workout | null>'.
